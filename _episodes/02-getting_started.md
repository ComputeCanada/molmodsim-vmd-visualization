### Starting VMD


### Downloading PDB files
We will be using X-ray crystallographic structure of human hemoglobin, PDB file 1SI4.

VMD can directly query PDB database.

On the **'VMD Main'** window menu select **'File' > 'Data' > 'PDB Database Query'**. This will open the **'VMD PDB Tool'**.

Enter 1SI4 and click **'Load into new molecule in VMD'**.

### Opening a PDB file saved in your computer.
On the “VMD Main” window menu select **'File' > 'New Molecule'**. This will
open the **'Molecule File Browser'**.


### Interacting with molecules

#### Obtaining good views for molecules
          Hot keys  MAC touch pad     windows

Rotate       R      click and hold    left,right buttons
Scale        S      2 fingers
Translate    T
Reset View   =
Set Center   c
Perpetual rotation x,y,z


### Loading separate parameter and structure files.
